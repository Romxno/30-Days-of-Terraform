## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through the **#30DaysOfTerraform** challenge a comprehensive 30-video course focused on mastering Infrastructure as Code with AWS. After building a foundation through my AWS blogging series, I'm now taking the next step with this structured curriculum that progresses from core concepts to real-world production projects.

Each day combines video lessons with practical AWS implementation, ensuring that concepts translate into working cloud infrastructure. The repository serves as both a learning log and a hands-on practice space for anyone following this curriculum.

### Core Objectives 🎯

- Build sustainable learning habits through daily practice
- Master Terraform fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Complete 10 mini-projects and 5 real-world production projects
- Develop production-ready skills for AWS infrastructure management
- Create a comprehensive reference for Infrastructure as Code patterns

## Learning Philosophy 💡

> "Expertise is built through consistent, deliberate practice not sporadic bursts of enthusiasm."

This challenge operates on several foundational principles:

**Daily Consistency ⏰**  
Small, incremental progress compounds into significant skill development. Showing up daily, regardless of circumstances, builds both knowledge and discipline.

**Hands-On AWS Implementation 🔨**  
Every concept must be implemented on AWS. Reading documentation is valuable; provisioning real cloud resources is transformative.

**Public Accountability 📢**  
Documenting progress publicly creates commitment and provides value to others walking similar paths.

**Authentic Documentation 📝**  
This repository captures real learning including struggles, debugging sessions, and iterative improvements.

## Technical Curriculum 🎓

The 30-day progression follows a comprehensive course structure divided into three modules:

### Module 1: Core Concepts (Days 1-13) 🏗️
**Fundamentals & Syntax**
- Introduction to Infrastructure as Code and Terraform
- Terraform providers and version management
- VPC and S3 bucket creation
- State file management and remote backends
- Variables, locals, and file structure
- Type constraints (string, number, bool, map, set, list, tuple, objects)
- Meta-arguments (count, for_each, for loops)
- Lifecycle meta-arguments
- Dynamic blocks and expressions
- Built-in functions and practical examples
- Data sources

### Module 2: AWS Resources (Days 14-24) 🏛️
**Mini Projects & Production Implementations**
- **Project 1**: Static website hosting (S3 + CloudFront)
- **Project 2**: VPC and peering setup
- **Project 3**: IAM authentication and service accounts
- **Project 4**: AWS Web Apps with Elastic Beanstalk
- **Project 5**: AWS Lambda functions
- **Project 6**: Terraform provisioners (local, remote, file)
- **Real-time Project 1**: EKS cluster with custom modules
- **Project 7**: AWS policy and governance
- **Project 8**: RDS database setup
- **Project 9**: AWS monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS, log alerts)
- **Project 10**: High availability infrastructure (ALB, Auto Scaling, NAT Gateway)

### Module 3: Advanced Concepts (Days 25-30) ⚙️
**Enterprise Patterns & Real-World Projects**
- **Real-time Project 2**: Terraform import (multiple methods)
- Terraform Cloud and workspace management
- **Real-time Project 3**: AWS DevOps CI/CD pipeline
- **Real-time Project 4**: GitOps with ArgoCD
- **Real-time Project 5**: 3-Tier architecture deployment

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Terraform installed (v1.0+)
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts

### For Practitioners 💼

Use this repository as:
- A reference for Terraform + AWS patterns and best practices
- Inspiration for your own learning challenge
- A template structure for documenting technical growth
- A collection of working examples for common AWS scenarios

---

## Motivation 🌟

Technical mastery requires more than understanding it demands consistent application. This challenge transforms abstract knowledge into practical capability through daily engagement with AWS infrastructure.

The constraint of 30 days creates urgency. The public nature creates accountability. The documentation creates value that extends beyond personal growth.

### Why Terraform with AWS? ☁️

Infrastructure as Code represents a fundamental shift in how we manage cloud resources. Terraform's declarative approach combined with AWS's comprehensive service ecosystem creates a powerful foundation for modern cloud engineering.

**AWS Benefits:**
- Industry-leading cloud platform with global reach
- Extensive service catalog for diverse workloads
- Strong community and enterprise adoption
- Excellent documentation and learning resources

**Terraform Advantages:**
- Provider-agnostic approach (valuable beyond AWS)
- Declarative syntax for clear intent
- State management for infrastructure tracking
- Extensive module ecosystem
